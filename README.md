# Experience Overview 🐢
SeeTurtles offers an immersive journey through coastal and underwater environments, focusing on sea turtle conservation and marine ecology. Your experience unfolds in two distinct phases:

## Coastal Exploration 🏖️
- Discover interactive signs marked with special indicators throughout the beach environment. Each sign provides valuable insights into sea turtle ecology and conservation efforts.
- Engage in conservation activities:
  - Collect scattered trash
  - Dismantle sandcastles
- Once you've interacted with all signs, a new marker will appear over a nest of sea turtle eggs. Interact with this marker to witness the heartwarming spectacle of baby turtles making their way to the ocean.

## Underwater Adventure 🌊
- After observing the turtle hatchlings, a new interactive marker will transport you to a vibrant underwater scene.
- In this submerged world:
  - Explore more interactive signs to deepen your understanding of marine ecosystems
  - Participate in an underwater cleanup activity, removing harmful debris from the ocean floor

Throughout both phases, your actions directly contribute to creating a safer environment for sea turtles and other marine life, while learning about the delicate balance of coastal and marine ecosystems.
